# About me

Hi I'm Nora and I'm new to the world of software development. After years in retail managmenent and sales, then motherhood, I've embarked on a new journey of learning to code. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Development with MERN course through MIT xPro. I find the learning both challenging and interesting and am excited to apply what I learn here. This page is a work in progress!
